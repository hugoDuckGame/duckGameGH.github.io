    <h2>Equitable - Check your products for nestle</h2>
    <div class="main">
        <h4>Nestle is a Swiss company that owns almost half of the existing food and cosmetics brands, but it has had its fair share of controversies because they do not respect human rights and steal resources from developing countries. For example, by charging them for their own water. Therefore, a lot of people, including myself, have decided to boycott this horrible brand. However, as they own a lot of brands, it can be hard to know which products are from them and which are not. That's why I developed this tool where you can type in the barcode of a product, and it will tell you if you can buy it or not.</h4>
        <h3>Please insert EAN13 barcode value of the product to check if it comes from nestle</h3>
        <input type="text" id="numb" name="id">

        <div class="cube animate__animated animate__shakeX" id="nestle">NESTLE PRODUCT</div>
        <div class="cube animate__animated animate__tada" id="notNestle">NOT A NESTLE PRODUCT</div>
        <div class="cube animate__animated animate__rubberBand" id="unable">Unable to find the asked product</div>
    </div>
    <p>Future updates : Add a link to all alternatives to a nestle product, fix the name of the product (doesnt show half of the time), make it mobile friendly because nobody does his groceries with a pc :)</p>
