    <h2>Equitable - Check your products for nestle</h2>
    <div class="main">
        <h4>Context : Nestle is a swiss company who owns almost half of existing food/cosmetics brands, but it has had it's lot of controversies, because <br> they dont respect human rights and steal resources from developping countries for exapmle by charging them for their own water. So, a lot of people including me have decided to boycott as they can the horrible brand. But as they own a lot of brands, it can be hard to know what products are from them and which are not so that's why i developped this tool where you can type in the barcode of a product and it will tell you if you can buy it or not.</h4>
        <h3>Please insert EAN13 barcode value of the product to check if it comes from nestle</h3>
        <input type="text" id="numb" name="id">
        <button class="button-27" role="button" onclick="search()">Search</button>
        <div class="spinner" id="spinner"></div>
        <div id="name"></div>
        <div class="cube animate__animated animate__shakeX" id="nestle">NESTLE PRODUCT</div>
        <div class="cube animate__animated animate__tada" id="notNestle">NOT A NESTLE PRODUCT</div>
    </div>
    <p>Future updates : Add a link to all alternatives to a nestle product, fix the name of the product (doesnt show half of the time)</p>
